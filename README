NAME
    App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple - application class for managing a simple
    sysadmin log

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        require App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple;
        App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple->new(logdir => '/var/log/sysadmin')->run();

DESCRIPTION
    "App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple" provides an easy way to maintain a simple
    single-host system administration log.

    The log is single-host in the sense that it does not log anything about
    the host. While you can obviously state what host you're talking about
    in your log entry, there is nothing done automatically to differentiate
    such log entries, and there is no built-in way to log from one host to
    another.

    The logs themselves are also simple - you get a single line of plain
    text to say what you have to say. That line gets logged in a fashion
    that is easy to read with this script, with cat, or it can be parsed
    with Text::Markdown (or Text::MultiMarkdown, which is a more modern
    drop-in replacement) and served on the web.

    If you need more than a single line of text, you may wish to use that
    line to point to a pastebin - you can easily create and retrieve them
    from the command line with App::Pastebin::sprunge.

    There is also no way to audit that the logs are correct. It can be
    incorrect in a number of ways:

    *   SUDO_USER or USER can be spoofed

    *   The files can be edited at any time, they are chmod 644 and owned by
        an unprivileged user

    *   The timestamp depends on the system clock

    *   ...etc

    Nonetheless, this is a simple, easy, and fast way to get a useful script
    for managing a simple sysadmin log. We believe the 80/20 rule applies:
    You can get 80% of the functionality with only 20% of a "real" solution.
    In the future, each log entry might be committed to a git repository for
    additional tracking.

METHODS
  new
    Obviously, the constructor returns an "App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple"
    object. It takes a hash of options which specify:

   logdir
    The directory where to find the sysadmin log. Defaults to
    /var/log/sysadmin.

   user
    The user who owns the sysadmin log. Should be unprivileged, but could be
    anything. Defaults to the current user.

   date
    The date to use instead of today.

   udp
    A hashref of data regarding UDP usage. If you don't want to send a UDP
    datagram, omit this. Otherwise, it has the following structure:

        my %udp_data = (
            irc => 1,           # Whether to insert IRC colour codes
            host => 'localhost',# What hostname to send to
            port => 9002,       # What port to send to
        );

   index_preamble
    The text to prepend to the index page. Can be anything - by default, it
    is a short explanation of the rationale for using this system of
    logging, which probably won't make sense for your context.

   view_preamble
    A string which gets prepended to the log being viewed (ie. at the top of
    the log file).

   read_from
    An opened filehandle reference to read from to get the log entry.
    Defaults to "STDIN".

  run
    This runs the application in the specified mode: view or log (default).
